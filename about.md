My name is Emulie and I am currently studying in computer science and mathematics at Université de 
Montréal. My main domain of interest is the application of data science and
machine learning in finance, althought I would love 
to learn how it can be applied to game development, bioinformatics and robotics.

# Currently Studying

I took 3 classes this semester:

- MAT2412: Analyse Numérique
- IFT3295: Bioinformatique
- IFT3395: Fondements en apprentissage machine



I am also involved in: 

- Project X: a machine learning competition in which we have 4 months to write 
  an academic paper centered around human-human interaction
- Tennis analysis research under Jonathan Tremblay
- Robotics Club


I am also TA for two classes this sessions:

- IFT1215: Introduction aux systèmes informatiques
- IFT1227: Architecture des ordinateurs

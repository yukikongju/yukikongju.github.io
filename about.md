My name is Emulie and I am currently studying in computer science and mathematics at Université de 
Montréal. My main domain of interest is the application of data science and
machine learning in finance, althought I would love 
to learn how it can be applied to game development, bioinformatics and robotics.

# Currently Studying

This semester, I decided to take only 3 classes, as I wanted to get more involved 
in the student consil and wanted to take part in other projects and competitions.

The classes I end up choosing were:

- MAT2412: Analyse Numérique
- IFT3295: Bioinformatique
- IFT3395: Fondements en apprentissage machine

At first, I didn't want to take the numerical analysis class because I thought 
it wasn't really related to what I was intersted in: machine learning. However, 
this class end up being one of the class I enjoyed the most. The professor 
is one of the best teacher I crossed path with, and even though the work was 
quite intensive (we had one homework every week), they were pertinents. We 
ended up discussing about techniques we can use to reduce errors and computation 
time when computing derivatives, integrals, solving linear systems, ... This 
class is probably my favorite one!

Even though I was quite familiar with machine learning, I had heard great 
things about that class, so I wanted to take it in order to check if my 
comprehension was correct. Turns out this class is pretty intensive requiring 
both advanced matrix derivatives knowledge and programming skills. With one 
quiz every week, 4 homeworks, 2 competitions and one final, I couldn't say it 
was easy!


I am also TA for two classes:

- IFT1215: Introduction aux systèmes informatiques
- IFT1227: Architecture des ordinateurs

Some cool ressources I used to learn:

- [Reinforcement Learning Ressources](https://github.com/dennybritz/reinforcement-learning)
- [Practical RL](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/Practical_RL)
- [DL Course](https://github.com/simoninithomas/Deep_reinforcement_learning_Course)
- [UC San Diego BIMM 143: Bioniformatics](https://bioboot.github.io/bimm143_F18/lectures/)
- [Solutions to Sipser Theory of Computation](https://github.com/gaurangsaini/sipser-computation-3rd-solutions)
- [Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/nlp_course)

## Research and Competition

- Project X: a machine learning competition in which we have 4 months to write 
  an academic paper centered around human-human interaction
- Tennis analysis research under Jonathan Tremblay

## Extracurriculars

- Students Concil: Delegate for all maths-info students and 3rd years info students
- Robotics Club, Algorithmic Club
- Badminton, as usual

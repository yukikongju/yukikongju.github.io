My name is Emulie and I have a bachelor in Maths and Computer Science from the
University of Montr√©al. I currently work at BetterSleep as a data scientist 
on user acquisition and the core product. On the user acquisition side, 
I maintain the ELT pipeline to ingest, process and store data we get from 
our various partners, I create attribution models and build dashboards to estimate 
ads performance. On the product side, I design A/B tests, perform ad-hoc 
analyses to better understand user behavior and develop deep learning models 
to improve our sound recognition model and content recommendation system.
I am also doing my master at MILA.

Outside of work, I am an avid fan of sports. I am currently playing ultimate 
frisbee competitively and I used to play university-level badminton 
for the Carabins.

# Tips for learning mathematics on your own

Learning undergraduate maths on your own can be daunting if you don't know 
where to start, but I found that these tips helped me tremendously.

### Tip #1: Search for the best ressources and stick with them

The first challenge when learning new stuffs is that you don't know what 
you don't know. Therefore, the first step would be to search for the most 
interesting ressources: videos lectures, lecture notes, textbook, problem 
set and their solutions, ...

**How to choose the best lectures**

Usually, I like to have lectures which allows me to process the information 
more easily because the professor usually do the heavy lifting. However, 
the courses you find online may not be well suited for you. If the audio or 
video is not good, or you simply don't like the instructor accent, I would 
recommend to not use these video lectures. Also, I found that course that 
were presented in video capsules did not worked well for learning new concepts.
I usually used them to review a subject.
 
**How to choose the best textbook**

If you google the course that you want to take, a few text book may pop up 
in the recommendations. You may be able to download some textbook for free at
[pdfdrive.com](https://www.pdfdrive.com/) or [zlib.org](https://z-lib.org/).
The ideal textbook should have the following: 

1. Theory: the theorems should be well stated and well explained
2. Practice: problem set should follow every chapters/sections and ideally, 
   the solutions set would be available.
3. Notation: Different textbooks use different notations. Try to take one 
   with a notation that doesn't look to far from what you know.
4. Choose a textbook that is not too long. Realistically, you won't be able 
   to read 800 pages. Since you are self-taught, you only need to understand 
   the core concepts, which means that your textbook should be about 400 pages 
   maximum.

I really like the [Springer Undergraduate Books Series](https://www.springer.com/series/3423) and the [Springer Undergraduate Text Series](https://www.springer.com/series/666), which offers free well-written textbooks.

### Tip #2: Do a ton of exercices, but learn the theory first

Unlike high school maths, learning undergraduate maths is not only about 
learning how to solve one type of problem and reproducing that methodology 
to solve the same problem, but with different numbers. Undergraduate maths 
is all about how you can use the theorems you know to solve unknown problems.

Therefore, when I hop onto a new chapter, I like to do the following:

1. Check out the problem set. This allows me to understand the question the 
   chapter tries to answer, which allows me to assimilate the theory better
2. Learn the theory. 
   + Understand what the theorems means and how it can be applied to solve 
     problem. Remeber to check if the hypotheses hold true before using them.
   + Understand the proof ie why the theorem is true. Often, the strategies 
     used to prove a theorem share a lot of similarities with the strategies 
     you will use to solve the problem
3. Do the problem set without checking at the solutions first. A big part of 
   learning maths is the struggle that is required to solve a question. If 
   you are really stuck, you may take a peak at the solution to see where 
   you got stuck, but make sure you can solve the problem without looking 
   at the solution.

### Tip #3: Remember the outcome of the problem you solve and the technique you used

Often, problem set are built in a way where the solution to a question use 
the outcome of one of the previous questions, so you need to remember 
(1) the technique you used to solve the problem, and (2) the outcome 
of the problem.

### Tip #4: Make a cheatsheet and use it as an active recall method

I think there are 3 steps to learning: 

1. Understanding the material: We want to make the learning process as easy 
   as possible.
2. Retrieving the information: Once we understand the theorems, we want to 
   know what they say, what are their hypotheses and how they apply without 
   looking at our notes
3. Applying the information: Solving problems

Usually, students know that they have to understand the material and do the 
problem set to succeed, but I believe that looking at the information one time 
is not enough to learn it. To really undestand a concept, you need time to 
let the information sink in, and you also need to be able to recall it.

The cheatsheet allows you to do just that. By adding new theorems to your 
cheatsheet everytime you encounter something new, you will have a concise 
summary of what you have learned. I like to review my sheet often and 
ask myself the following questions when checking the theorems:

- Proof: why this theorem holds true.
- Hypotheses: what do I need to check to use the theorem
- Problem: how can I use the theorem to solve problem
- Big Picture: why do we learn about this theorem

Answering these questions using the [rubber duck technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) allows me to see where my knowledges gaps are.


### Tip #5: Keep all your questions at one place

Whenever a question for which I can't find the solution to come up, wether it 
be about theory or about practice, I put them on my weekly page in my 
bullet journal so that I know to work on them later.

I found that keeping questions for all of my classes at different spots 
made it tougher to know on what I need to work on because I don't constantly 
look at what my weaknesses are.

You can then ask these questions to your teachers or on Stack Exchange.

### Tip #6: Make the processing phase easier by 

I like having lectures to watch because it makes processing the information 
easier. I found that following only the textbook takes too much brain power, 
so I can't study for long periods.

Ideally, I would watch the lecture and take my own notes whilst having the 
lecture notes open for references, and after class, I would reformulate 
the big idea of the classes in another notebook. 

However, for course for which I didn't have access to the lectures, what I 
usually do is to check out all the theorems first without doing the proofs so 
that I understand where we are going, and then I try to work out the proofs.

Another important thing is to understand the previous concept before going 
to the next, because unlike other fields, mathematics builds on top of each 
concepts.

### Tip #7: Work on Speed



### Tip #8: Don't try to understand everything

This tip seems like a contradiction to what I've said earlier, but it is not.
The goal is to have a understanding deep enough to know which problem we are 
required to solve and the theorems used to do so, but you really don't need to 
remember the proof for every theorems.

Often, if you understand the concept well enough, you prove the propositions 
and other lemmas by yourself.

# Course Contents 

### Calculus

I would recommend [Professor Butler](https://www.youtube.com/c/ProfessorButler/)
lecture series on calculus. He explains the methodology and works through 
several example. His website has a bunch of exams and quiz samples.

**Stochastic Processes**




### Statistics

There are 4 courses that can be taken when learning statistics: 

1. Introduction to Stastistics
2. Concepts and Methods in Statistics

### Differential Equations

There are two courses that should be taken to learn differential equations: 
1. Ordinary Differential Equations

**Ordinary Differential Equations**

Although I really liked [Professor Butler](https://www.youtube.com/c/ProfessorButler/) calculus courses, I feel like the mathematical rigor required for different 
equations wasn't really there. However, I still think that his 
[Differential Equations Lectures](https://www.calc4.org/) can still be used 
for the ODE course if they are complemented with Georges Simmons Textbook

- [Professor Butler - Ordinary Differential Equations](https://www.calc4.org/)
- Textbook: Georges Simoons - Differential Equations with Applications and Historical Notes
- Texbook Solutions: [Georges Simmons Textbook Solutions](https://www.studocu.com/in/document/birla-institute-of-technology-and-science-pilani/differential-equation/424580021-george-f-simmons-differential-equations-with-applications-and-historical-notes-mc-graw-hill-science-1991-solutions-pdf/9247025)

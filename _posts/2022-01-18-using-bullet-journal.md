# Why use a bullet journal

I you are anything like me, you keep a long list of things you want to accomplish,
but seems to never do them. After several tries, I found that there is only 
two components to goal setting: 

1. Know what your goals are
2. Knock them off one by one by order of priority

I found that bullet journaling helps me accomplsih these two goals by providing:

- tracking system to keep track of the things I need to accomplish
- self-reflection by reviewing random toughts I had throughout the day

I like to keep 2 bullet journals: one as my tracking system and the other 
for my toughts and review process.

# Part I - Knowing what to work towards: The art of setting goals

The first component of goal setting is knowing what your goals are. At first 
glance, this step seems to be really easy, but the truth is that we often 
misidentify what our true goals are.

One exercice I like to do is to ask myself where do I see myself 5-10 years 
from now, which allows me to have a clear vision of what I want to do with my
life. For this exercice, I like to talk in the present, as if I had already 
accomplished all the goals I set out. I also like to have a few axis: 
(1) work/career (2) familiy/relationship (3) health (4) hobbies. Don't 
worry if something seems far away or not realizable in your eyes, just write 
it down.

Once I described my ideal life in 5 years, I want to identify my different goals and what 
are their priority. I like to categorize them into 3 ways: 

- WANT: The things that would be cool to accomplish/do/learn, but would be 
  okay if they didn't happen
- NEED: The things you need to do to be proud of yourself and be fullfilled
- MUST: The things you must embody to be able to live with yourself.

I also like to check what things I didn't mention in my statement. If something 
did not show up in, it is often a good sign that I should not waste time 
to pursue that stuffs.

From this goal list, you want to compare where you are to where you want to 
be, and set milestone you can work toward. For each milestone, list out 5-10 
ideas that can may help you accomplish your goals. These ideas are what 
you are going to be working on a weekly/monthly basis to achieve the milestone 
you set

## Example





# Part II - Executing the game plan using the bullet journal as a tracking system

Part I was all about planning what we needed to work on in order to achieve 
our goal. Part II is about executing that plan. My bullet journal has 5 sections:

- Yearly logs: a list of goals I want to accomplish for a given year
- Quarter Logs: 
- Monthly Logs:
- Weekly Logs:
- Daily Logs:

## Yearly Logs


## Quarter Logs



## Monthly Logs

Monthly logs is great because it allows me to:

- Track a new habit/metric that I want to measure
- Highlights of the month: tracking the cool stuffs that happen in my life



## Weekly Logs

My weekly logs concist of two pages:

- master todo list:
  + Top: theme of the week, important dates (remise, events, ...)
  + Left: what I want to work on to reach my goals
  + Right: managerial tasks I need to do, but doesn't help me get nearer 
    to my goal
- follow up list:
  + Top: Classes attendance and checklist for school
  + Bottom: stuffs I didn't understand and need to research

## Daily Logs

My daily routine concist of two things:

- morning routine: list out 3 goals to do for the day
- night routine: a 5 minutes review of what my day looked like and additional 
  insights

**Morning Routine: Making the Todo List**

I usually keep 2 todo list: one master todo list for the week, and one daily 
todo list, which consist of 3 things I need to accomplish for the day and 
an estimate for how much time it will take to accomplish the task and when 
should I work on it during the day. I often like to use my master list to 
choose my daily goals.

Keeping this list at 3 items is really important because

1. It makes a priority list: I work on each item until it is completed before 
   going to the next to avoid [context switching](https://blog.doist.com/context-switching/)
2. It gives me peace of mind: once I finish these tasks, I am free to do 
   whatever I want

If I can't finish these 3 tasks, it means that either:

- I underestimated the time it would take to accomplish a given task
- I overestimated the number of things I could accomplish in a given day
- I wasted too much time on the internet or doing stuffs that didn't matter

**Night Routine: Daily Review**




# Part III - Improving your current system by reviewing your toughts journal

As I said earlier, I like to keep 2 journals: one as my tracking system, and 
the other as my toughts process. I like having a journal where I can write the 
random thoughts I get throughout the day, because often times, I will see 
a common theme across those thoughts, which gives me insight on where I 
can improve my system.

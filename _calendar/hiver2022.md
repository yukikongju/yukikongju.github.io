# School

I took the following classes this session:

- ~~STT 2400: Régression Linéaire~~
- STT 2700: Concepts et méthodes en statistiques
- MAT 2155: Équations Différentielles
- IFT 2905: Interface Humain-Machine
- IFT 3155: Informatique Quantique

The course in statistical method was interesting to me, because instead of 
assuming the population parameters, we found ways to estimate them from 
the sample we have using either (1) minimizing the sum of the log likelihood or 
(2) methodes des moments. We also learned how to build confidence intervals 
around these estimates and perform parametric and non-parametric tests.


I was also currently TA for the course IFT 1227 - Computer Architecture


## Takeaways

I felt overworked all session long and since I got covid, I missed twos weeks 
of class and all of my midterms. I didn't have my enthusiasm anymore. Instead, 
I was spending all of my time at the gym and playing badminton. I got great 
results, but felt like sacrificing my mental health for grades and work wasn't
worth it.

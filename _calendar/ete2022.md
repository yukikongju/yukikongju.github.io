# Internship

I am currently a Junior Data Specialist intern at BnP Paribas.

My main tasks are to modelize employee attrition and to accelerate
communication streamlines using machine learning. I also undertake
tasks related to the ETL automation process.

This experience was my first internship experience and I had a great time!
Most of my time was spent on doing all the fun things a data scientist has 
to do: exploring the data and building the models. Even though I was an 
intern, I really had a white card to do anything I wanted modelization wise.
I had the opportunity to learn about the in and out of bureaucracy and learn 
how to connect with people.

# School

I took the following classes this semester:

- IFT 1227: Architecture des ordinateurs
- IFT 1575: Modèle de Recherche Opérationnelles
- IFT 2105: Informatique Théorique
- IFT 2125: Introduction à l'algorithmie
- IFT 3700: Science des données

The computer architecture class was, like its prerequisite, underwhelming. 
I don't know why I kept getting my hope up and doing system programming
in C, but we end up doing none of that. Instead, we end up writing in VHDL and 
assembly, which is also okay I guess. 

The operation research class was a class that I enjoyed although I wanted to 
do a little more programming. We learned about the simplex algorithm for linear 
and non-linear programming, network problems (shortest path, minimum spanning 
tree, flots, ...), stochastics models, branch-and-bound, ...

The algorithmic class was great! We learned how to develop our own algorithms 
using greedy, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programmingbacktracking and even 
probabilistic patterns, which was something I neved heard before taking that 
class. One of the most useful class I have taken.

The theory of computation class was awesome! We learned about automaton and 
what makes a programming language complete or not. We learned about the 
Church-Turing Thesis, the Cook-Levin Theorem, the Chomsky Hierarchy and the 
famous halting problem.

I pretty much knew everything that was thought in the data science class since 
I've read quite a few books on data science during my CEGEP years, but I still 
learned okay theorems.

I was also lucky to land my first TA job for the class IFT 1215 - Systèmes Informatiques!

# Takeaways

Although my grades were good, I am a bit unhappy with the way this session went 
because I spent all of my time either studying or training. I didn't take 
the time to see friends, get involved in student life and meet new people, which 
are things I wanted to do a uni.

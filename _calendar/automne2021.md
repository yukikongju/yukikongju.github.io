## School

I took the following classes this semester:

- IFT 1227: Architecture des ordinateurs
- IFT 1575: Modèle de Recherche Opérationnelles
- IFT 2105: Informatique Théorique
- IFT 2125: Introduction à l'algorithmie
- IFT 3700: Science des données

The computer architecture class was, like its prerequisite, underwhelming. 
I don't know why I kept getting my hope up and doing system programming
in C, but we end up doing none of that. Instead, we end up writing in VHDL and 
assembly, which is also okay I guess. 

The operation research class was a class that I enjoyed although I wanted to 
do a little more programming. We learned about the simplex algorithm for linear 
and non-linear programming, network problems (shortest path, minimum spanning 
tree, flots, ...), stochastics models, branch-and-bound, ...

The algorithmic class was great! We learned how to develop our own algorithms 
using greedy, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programmingbacktracking and even 
probabilistic patterns, which was something I neved heard before taking that 
class. One of the most useful class I have taken.


I was also lucky to land my first TA job for the class IFT 1215 - Systèmes Informatiques!

## Takeaways

I spend most of my time either studying or training, not going out much. My 
grades were good and my badminton was fine, but I still felt like something 
was missing...

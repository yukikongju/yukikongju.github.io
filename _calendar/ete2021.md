# School

I decided to take one classe this summer:

- MAT 2717: Processus Stochastiques

This course is a continuation of the probability course. We introduced the 
concept of stochastic process, which is basically a random variable in which 
we need to consider the notion of time. We learned about Markov processes, 
martingales and the gambler ruin's problem. I really enjoyed this class and 
it really set me up to understand Monte Carlo processes.

# Internship

I also did an internship at Vortex Lab, where out team was tasked to 
train a truck to park itself using reinforcement learning. My main task was 
to implement the DDPG algorithm to reduce deadly "jackknive" situations 
and to patch some bugs in Vortex, our company simulator.

Although the project was pretty cool, the things I am taking away the most 
is how we should work in a big codebase where more than 15 people working on 
it.

# Takeaways

This summer felt fast-pace because I had both an intership an a class, but I 
still had time to enjoy myself. I wanted to take two classes, one on
complex number and one on differential equations, but it kind of flopped 
because I wanted to do too much at the same time. Nonetheless, I still 
learned that I feel way better when I can push through and prove to myself 
that I can accomplish hard things than when I take things easy.

# School

This semester was my first at uni. I was lucky to have some classes credited, 
so I only had 3 classes this semester:

- MAT 1400: Calcul 1
- MAT 1600: Algèbre Linéaire
- STT 1700: Intro à la Statistique

The calculus class was a continuation of what 
we had learned in Cegep. We learned how to do derivation and integration, but 
this time, instead of dealing with one variable, we dealt with multiples variables.
We introduced the concept of partial derivatives and optimization, concepts which 
will be useful when learning about machine learning.

The linear algebra class was a also generalization of what we had done in Cegep.
We learned how to apply the same concepts (vector space, linear transformation, 
linear transformation, ...)
for mathematical object other than eudlidean vectors, namely polynomials and 
complex numbers. We also also learned to use basis to change our coordinate 
system, something we hadn't done in cegep. We also expanded our knowledge on 
orthogonal projection and diagonalization.

The intro to statistics class was a pretty easy class. For the 
whole semester, we pretty much assumed that we knew the population parameters, 
thing that we don't in real life. We ask questions such as 
"how lucky am I to get a sample of mean mu and variance sigma knowing the 
population parameters" or "how confident am I that the true answer resides 
inside given values".

Because of covid, I wasn't really involved in clubs or anything. We still had 
badminton practices, but with all the tournaments canceled, it was kind of 
hard to keep the moral up...

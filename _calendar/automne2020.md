# School

This semester was my first at uni. I was lucky to have some classes credited, 
so I only had 3 classes this semester:

- MAT 1400: Calcul 1
- MAT 1600: Algèbre Linéaire
- STT 1700: Intro à la Statistique

The calculus class was a continuation of what 
we had learned in Cegep. We learned how to do derivation and integration, but 
this time, instead of dealing with one variable, we dealt with multiples variables.
We introduced the concept of partial derivatives and optimization, concepts which 
will be useful when learning about machine learning.

The linear algebra class was a also generalization of what we had done in Cegep.
We learned how to apply the same concepts (vector space, linear transformation, 
linear transformation, ...)
for mathematical object other than eudlidean vectors, namely polynomials and 
complex numbers. We also also learned to use basis to change our coordinate 
system, something we hadn't done in cegep. We also expanded our knowledge on 
orthogonal projection and diagonalization. This was one of the first 
proof-based class I did, which I quite enjoyed.

The intro to statistics class was a pretty easy class. For the 
whole semester, we pretty much assumed that we knew the population parameters, 
something that is unrealistic in real life. We ask questions such as 
"how lucky am I to get a sample of mean mu and variance sigma knowing the 
population parameters" or "how confident am I that the true answer resides 
inside given values". It helped me have a better grasp of how p-value works 
and how p-hacking can occurs, which are concepts I still use to this day 
when I read academic papers.

# Extracurriculars

Because of covid, the department didn't allow us to gather, so I couldn't 
get involved in clubs. Fortunately, I was still able to train with the Carabins 
since we were a "competitive athletes". I was still able to train around 20 
hours a week, but with all the tournaments cancelled, 
it was harder to keep the intensity up. Still, I am grateful for that opportunity 
because I got to learn to adapt my training under constraints. We were not able 
to do "multi-birds" or be closer than 3 meters away, so we focussed a lot on 
continuous drills and singles, which are not my forte.

# Takeaways

I have come to realize that there are things that I take for granted 
(the ability to go outside, meetup with friends and family, do sports) and 
I want to be more mindful and grateful of what I have.

## School

This semester, I decided to take only 3 classes, as I wanted to get more involved 
in the student consil and wanted to take part in other projects and competitions.

The classes I end up choosing were:

- MAT2412: Analyse Numérique
- IFT3295: Bioinformatique
- IFT3395: Fondements en apprentissage machine

At first, I didn't want to take the numerical analysis class because I thought 
it wasn't really related to what I was intersted in: machine learning. However, 
this class end up being one of the class I enjoyed the most. The professor 
is one of the best teacher I crossed path with, and even though the work was 
quite intensive (we had one homework and one test every week), they were pertinents. We 
ended up discussing about techniques we can use to reduce errors and computation 
time when computing derivatives, integrals, solving linear systems, ... This 
class is probably my favorite one!

Even though I was quite familiar with machine learning, I had heard great 
things about that class, so I wanted to take it in order to check if my 
comprehension was correct. Turns out this class is pretty intensive requiring 
both advanced matrix derivatives knowledge and programming skills. With one 
quiz every week, 4 homeworks, 2 competitions and one final, I couldn't say it 
was easy!

The bioinformatics class ended up being an algorithmic class focussed on 
string algorithms, which wasn't what I expected but what fun. Even though I 
got a very good grade, I still don't know what a phylogeny tree is and how 
it is actually used in practice...

# Teaching Assistant

I was also TA for two classes:

- IFT1215: Introduction aux systèmes informatiques
- IFT1227: Architecture des ordinateurs

Some cool ressources I used to learn:

- [Reinforcement Learning Ressources](https://github.com/dennybritz/reinforcement-learning)
- [Practical RL](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/Practical_RL)
- [DL Course](https://github.com/simoninithomas/Deep_reinforcement_learning_Course)
- [UC San Diego BIMM 143: Bioiformatics](https://bioboot.github.io/bimm143_F18/lectures/)
- [Solutions to Sipser Theory of Computation](https://github.com/gaurangsaini/sipser-computation-3rd-solutions)
- [Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/nlp_course)

# Research 

I was a lab assistant in the lab of Jonathan Tremblay, where our primary 
focus was to leverage biometrics data to periodize the training loads of 
tennis and hockey athletes. My main tasks were:
- Build a pipeline to ingest data we got from Catapult (JSON)
- Perform peak analysis on player acceleration to establish a baseline on 
  their training load. I also used PCA to understand a player capacity 
  against other athletes
- Analyze game play sequence to identify areas of improvement

I also had the opportunity to work with Felix Auger-Aliassime, who I have been 
a fan of, which was great!

# Competition

- Project X: a machine learning competition in which we have 4 months to write 
  an academic paper centered around human-human interaction

# Extracurriculars

This semester, I decided to get involved in clubs and social activities. I 
was wearing the following hats:
- Students Concil: I was the official representant of all maths-info students 
  and 3rd years computer science students. I was the bridge between profs and 
  students when issues arise, I had the ability to suggest courses improvements 
  to our head of department Sylvie Hamel and organized activities.
- Co-president of the AI club: My co-president and I were giving workshops 
  on machine learning concepts twice a week and organize meetups to discuss 
  new research advancements
- Member of Robotics Club, Algorithmic Club
- Carabins Badminton, as usual


# Takeaways

1. I think my time as a TA is coming to an end. I don't enjoy correcting 
   homework like I used to and I'd rather work on my side projects.
2. I loved being involved in the student concil! I found that getting 
   involved was very beneficial as I got to meet interesting and passionate 
   people.

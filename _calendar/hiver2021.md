# School

I took 4 classes that semester:

- MAT 1000: Analyse I
- MAT 1720: Probabilités
- IFT 1215: Intro aux systèmes informatiques
- IFT 2015: Structures de données

The analysis course was probably one of the class where I struggle the most 
because I hadn't done much proofs before, but it ended up being the reason 
why I love maths so much now. At first, I wasn't a fan of the chapter on 
the completeness axioms and well-ordered sets (I am still not convinced that
Cantor's diagonal argument to prove that rational number are countable is valid, 
why would a diagonal be a good enough proof lol),
but I was hooked when we introduced the TVI theorem and the mean theorem.
Even though I struggle pretty much all the semester, I got an epiphany 2 weeks 
before our finals and ended up with a very good grade.
I know that I will probably never use what I've learned in that class in 
my day to day job, but I'm really glad I decided to keep going, because it 
showed me that I can have breakthrough if I put my mind to it.

The probability class was a standard probability class where we introduce 
the concepts of counting, expectancy/variance of discrete and continuous 
distributions and the central limits theorem (and its cousins). I really liked 
the contents of that class because I found the proofs simple and elegant, 
but I didn't like the way it was taught because 
I felt like we jumped into paradox to quickly without getting a good intuition 
of the concept first. 

The computer systems course was underwhelming to say the least. I was looking 
at CMU curriculum beforehand where the students were writing in C and doing 
reverse engineering, but we end up learning about floatting points number 
and circuits for half the semester (CMU learns that in 1 months) and 
about a pseudo assembly language called LMC and bash for the end of the semester.
It was an easy A+, but it felt like I didn't learned much in that class.

The data structure class was pretty complete. We learned how to implement 
the insert, delete and search operations for diverse data structures (queue, 
stacks, BST, B-trees, heaps, hashmap, ...), but since our professor also 
thought discrete maths, we were mostly tested on our ability to prove time 
and space complexity and data structures properties. I have realized that I 
love solving little coding problems LeetCode style.
